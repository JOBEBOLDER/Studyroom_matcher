## 🌟 Overview

**Study Room Matcher** is a prototype mobile app aimed at solving a common problem for students: finding the right virtual study environment. Whether you're studying for finals, preparing for standardized exams, or just want silent co-working sessions, this app helps you match with others who share your study vibe.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- ❌ No existing platforms effectively match students to virtual study spaces tailored to their **subject**, **study style**, or **background sound**.
- ⏱ Students waste time hopping across platforms (Zoom, Discord) trying to find compatible study partners.
- 🙁 Lack of personalization leads to distraction, isolation, or disengagement.

---

## 👥 Target Users

- College students who frequently join virtual study groups (Zoom/Discord).
- High school or adult learners in remote learning environments.
- Users familiar with tech but frustrated by lack of smart matching features.

---

## 💡 Solution Highlights

- 🔍 **Search & Filter:** Choose preferences like subject, music, and group size.
- 🤖 **Smart Matchmaking:** Automated room suggestions (e.g., #Lofi+Calculus).
- 🛠️ **Room Creation:** Custom study room with shared tools, optional camera, and tags.
- 🗺️ **Onboarding + Profiles:** Tailored dashboards and profile-based recommendations.

## 🧪 Usability Testing Insights

Three testing sessions were conducted with participants from tech and data-related backgrounds. Key issues and improvements:

- 🛑 **Missing confirmation & feedback** during login and match stages → Added success messages and login buttons.
- 🔁 **Unclear navigation paths** → Introduced persistent home & back buttons.
- 🎨 **UI/UX inconsistency** → Aligned button styles and iconography across screens.
- 💬 **Confusing terminology** (e.g., “Cut”) → Replaced with real-world labels like "Camera".
- 🔊 **System feedback lacking** → Added visual match loaders and estimated wait times.

## 🔍 Heuristic Evaluation

Evaluator: **Jieyao Chen**  
Framework: [Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

| Heuristic                            | Key Findings                                                               |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Visibility of System Status      | Lacked feedback during loading → Added visual indicators                   |
| ✅ Match Between System & Real World | Used vague terms like "Enter" → Changed to "Join Room", added context      |
| ✅ Error Prevention                 | No confirmation before Quick Match → Now includes tooltip + confirmation   |
| ✅ Consistency & Standards          | Button and icon style inconsistencies → Standardized UI components         |
| ✅ Help and Documentation           | No onboarding → Added tooltips and “?” icon on first-time use              |
